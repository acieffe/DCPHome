Disney College Program Social Site

This site is a collection of modules and componants to create a website for Disney College Program participants of past and present to share information and connect with each other. This is the fourth iteration of this website and concept. The original purpose of the website stemed from a need to find a way for myself and others to find roommates with similar personalilities to make the college program more enjoyable. From there, the site added more survey and personality questions, and allowed users to share the link on social media. Then the next iteration allowed users to log in securely and search the existing users for roommates. The third iteration used a wordpress dating website backbone and used facebook or google to create a user profile with better search and chat capabilities. This iteration will take all of that and add even more functionality by allowing users to find factual information about the Disney College Program and up to date news from the program and the participants themselves.
